# Hey! I'm Caleb Graves!

I'm a Front-End Web Developer from St. George, Utah. I currently work for FamilySearch as a Web Development Intern, and as of December of 2024, I have my Bachelor's Degree from BYU-Idaho in Web Design and Development.

Here's a link to my resume site, which I built in Svelte!
