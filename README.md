# Hi! I'm Caleb Graves!

I'm a Front-End Web Developer living in Logan, Utah. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Web Design and Development from BYU-Idaho, a year and a half of experience as a Software Developer, and I'm currently looking for a full-time position in Software and/or Web Development

Here's a link to my resume site, which I built in Svelte!

## What I'm working on - Updated February 2026:

### Yahtzee Scorecard App
- I'm working on an app that I plan to put on the google play store that will act as a scorecard for Yahtzee.
  - The only such apps I can find either cost money for more features (such as more than 2 players), or have a bunch of ads. I'd like to provide one that is completely free without ads, because ads are annoying.
- It's available on web right now at [https://calebtgraves.github.io/Five-of-a-Kind-Scorecard/](https://calebtgraves.github.io/Five-of-a-Kind-Scorecard/).
  - It's built with Preact, and I'm wrapping it with Capacitor for mobile.
  - Also available to install as a PWA.

### RPG Game based on Dungeons and Dragons
- It's still in very early development, but the idea is that you can explore a world, fight monsters, get loot, and tell your own story, all without the need for a Game Master.

- The rules for combat are a simplified adaptation from D&d

### Plug-ins for Adobe InDesign
- I'm working on a couple of plug-ins for Adobe InDesign.
  - One allows for the automation of parent pages
    - Version 1.0 is available [here](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/c9349989/parent-page-rules)
  - The Other allows for better control over importing multi-page documents
- As these will be paid plug-ins on the Adobe Marketplace, the repos for both extensions are private.
