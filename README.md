# Hey! I'm Caleb Graves!

I'm a Front-End Web Developer from St. George, Utah. I currently work for FamilySearch as a Web Development Intern. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Web Design and Development from BYU-Idaho, and I'm currently looking for a full-time position, as my internship will soon end.

Here's a link to my resume site, which I built in Svelte!
